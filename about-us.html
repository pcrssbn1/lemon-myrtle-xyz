<h1>About Lemon Myrtle: From Rainforest to Global Markets</h1>

<section>
<h2>The Origins and Traditional Significance of Lemon Myrtle</h2>
<p>Lemon myrtle's story begins in the subtropical rainforests of eastern Australia, where the tree has flourished for millions of years. The plant grows naturally in a relatively limited range along the coastal areas of Queensland and northern New South Wales, typically in areas receiving 1200-1600mm of annual rainfall. These rainforest environments, characterized by rich volcanic soils and consistent moisture, provided ideal conditions for the species to develop its distinctive aromatic properties.</p>
<p>Aboriginal Australian communities, particularly the Bundjalung and Gumbaynggirr peoples, recognized lemon myrtle's value long before European contact. Traditional uses included crushing the leaves to treat colds, headaches, and various skin conditions. The leaves were also used to flavor foods and as a natural insect repellent. This knowledge, passed down through generations, represented sophisticated understanding of the plant's antimicrobial and aromatic properties that modern science would later confirm through laboratory analysis.</p>
<p>European documentation of lemon myrtle came relatively late in Australia's colonial history. German-Australian botanist Ferdinand von Mueller first scientifically described the species in 1853 during his extensive surveys of Queensland's flora. He classified it within the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic Australian natives like eucalyptus and tea tree. The species name 'citriodora' directly references the plant's citrus-like fragrance, though it shares no botanical relationship with true citrus species from the Rutaceae family.</p>
<p>Despite early documentation, lemon myrtle remained largely unknown outside Australia for over a century. The plant existed primarily in botanical collections and natural rainforest stands, with no commercial cultivation or widespread culinary use. This changed dramatically in the 1990s when Australia's native food industry began developing, driven by chefs seeking distinctive local ingredients and entrepreneurs recognizing export potential. Our <a href="/">index page</a> provides detailed information about the plant's botanical characteristics and current applications in cooking and wellness.</p>

<h2>Commercial Development and Modern Cultivation</h2>
<p>The transformation of lemon myrtle from wild rainforest tree to commercial crop represents one of Australia's native food industry success stories. Commercial cultivation began in earnest around 1989 when a handful of Queensland farmers planted the first dedicated lemon myrtle orchards. These pioneers faced significant challenges, as no established agricultural protocols existed for the species. They had to develop harvesting techniques, determine optimal planting densities, and establish processing methods through trial and error.</p>
<p>By the mid-1990s, approximately 30 hectares were under cultivation across Queensland and northern New South Wales. Farmers discovered that lemon myrtle adapts well to plantation conditions, growing more vigorously than in wild rainforest settings when provided adequate water and nutrients. Trees typically begin producing harvestable leaves within 18-24 months of planting, with full production capacity reached at 4-5 years. Modern plantations maintain tree heights at 2-3 meters through regular pruning, facilitating easier harvesting compared to wild trees that can reach 20 meters.</p>
<p>The processing industry developed alongside cultivation, with several companies establishing facilities to dry, mill, and package lemon myrtle products. Fresh leaves are typically dried within 24 hours of harvest to preserve maximum citral content and prevent enzymatic degradation. Commercial drying occurs in temperature-controlled facilities at 40-50°C, reducing moisture content from approximately 70% in fresh leaves to below 10% in the finished product. This careful processing ensures the dried leaves retain their intense aroma and flavor for 18-24 months.</p>
<p>Today, Australia produces approximately 8-10 tons of dried lemon myrtle annually, with about 60% destined for domestic consumption and 40% exported to markets including Japan, Europe, and North America. The industry supports roughly 50 growers and several processing companies, generating an estimated $3-5 million in annual farm gate value. Industry organizations like the Australian Native Food Industry Limited work to maintain quality standards and promote sustainable cultivation practices. The plant has also been successfully introduced to other suitable climates, with small-scale cultivation now occurring in parts of California, Hawaii, and other subtropical regions worldwide.

<h2>Scientific Research and Future Potential</h2>
<p>Scientific interest in lemon myrtle has grown substantially since 2000, with researchers investigating its chemical composition, antimicrobial properties, and potential applications beyond traditional uses. Studies have identified over 40 different compounds in lemon myrtle leaves and essential oil, though citral dominates at 90-98% of total volatile compounds. This exceptionally high citral concentration exceeds that of any other commercially available plant, making lemon myrtle valuable for both natural products and potential pharmaceutical applications.</p>
<p>Antimicrobial research has produced particularly promising results. A comprehensive 2003 study by researchers at Southern Cross University tested lemon myrtle essential oil against a panel of bacteria and fungi, finding significant activity against pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. Minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from 0.06% to 0.5% depending on the microorganism, suggesting potential applications in food preservation, natural medicine, and surface sanitization. Subsequent research has explored incorporating lemon myrtle extract into biodegradable food packaging films to extend shelf life of fresh produce.</p>
<p>The cosmetic and personal care industry has shown increasing interest in lemon myrtle as a natural ingredient. Its antimicrobial properties make it attractive for acne treatments and preservative systems, while the pleasant aroma enhances product appeal. Several Australian skincare companies have built brands around native botanicals including lemon myrtle, marketing products both domestically and internationally. Research published in the Journal of Cosmetic Science confirmed that lemon myrtle extract remains stable in cream formulations for 18 months when properly preserved with appropriate pH control.</p>
<p>Future research directions include investigating potential agricultural applications as a natural pesticide or fungicide, given the plant's strong antimicrobial properties. Preliminary studies suggest that lemon myrtle essential oil may help control certain crop pests and fungal diseases, potentially offering organic farmers a native Australian alternative to synthetic chemicals. Climate change research has also examined lemon myrtle's potential for cultivation in regions where traditional crops may become less viable, as the tree demonstrates reasonable drought tolerance once established and adapts to various soil types. According to research databases maintained by the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a>, over 50 peer-reviewed studies have examined various aspects of lemon myrtle chemistry and applications since 2000, with publication rates increasing in recent years.</p>
